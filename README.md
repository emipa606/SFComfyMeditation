★·.·´¯`·.·★ What does it do? ★·.·´¯`·.·★ 
Gives you 6 cushy comfy meditation pillows, one for each meditation focus type!

Stats:
10 beauty (except Minimal type has 0 beauty)
1 comfort

Pawns will sit on them and meditate at a nearby focus just like a meditation spot! So put them near your pawn's favored focus type and let them meditate away in comfort!

Exception: Dignified cushion acts as a throne! You can have your pawn meditate on it like a throne.
It will also satisfy room throne room requirements, but it does not give as powerful focus gain as a normal throne.

 ★·.·´¯`·.·★ Compatibility ★·.·´¯`·.·★ 
SHOULD be compatible with basically everything unless it directly messes with the meditation spot?
Save-game compatible.


 ★·.·´¯`·.·★ License ★·.·´¯`·.·★
